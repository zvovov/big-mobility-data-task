# Big Mobility Data Analytics for Public Health

Hello :wave:

This is my submission for the Data/Code Interview Task.

Please take a look at the [html notebook](https://github.com/zvovov/big-mobility-data-task/blob/main/Big%20Mobility%20Data%20Analytics%20-%20Task.html) of the Jupyter notebook 

You can alternatively look at the [ipynb notebook](https://github.com/zvovov/big-mobility-data-task/blob/main/Big%20Mobility%20Data%20Analytics%20-%20Task.ipynb), although the input datasets were too large to host on GitHub

Let me know your feedback. Thank you :smiley:
